```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run the application
poetry run streamlit run main.py

# Format code
poetry run invoke format

# Run all linters (yaml, ruff, mypy, pylint)
poetry run invoke lint

# Run tests
pytest

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_file.py::test_function
```

### Documentation (in docs/ directory)

```bash
cd docs
npm install
npm run start  # Development server
npm run build  # Build documentation

# Markdown linting (run from project root)
markdownlint docs/docs/**/*.mdx
markdownlint --fix docs/docs/**/*.mdx  # Auto-fix issues

# Vale documentation style validation (requires Vale to be installed)
vale $(find ./docs -type f \( -name "*.mdx" -o -name "*.md" \) | grep -v node_modules)
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build .
docker-compose up  # Runs on port 8501
```

## Architecture

### Core Structure

- **main.py**: Entry point - Emma homepage
- **menu.py**: Sidebar navigation system
- **emma/**: Core Python module with utilities and services
    - `infrahub.py`: Infrahub API integration
    - `assistant_utils.py`: AI assistant utilities
    - `streamlit_utils.py`: UI utilities
- **pages/**: Individual Streamlit pages for features
    - Schema management: builder, loader, visualizer
    - Data operations: importer, exporter
    - Schema library browser

### AI Integration

Emma integrates with OpenAI/LangChain for schema generation. The schema builder uses an AI assistant to help users create infrastructure schemas based on natural language descriptions. Key files:

- `pages/schema_builder.py`: Main AI-powered schema builder
- `emma/assistant_utils.py`: AI assistant utilities

### Schema System

Infrastructure schemas are YAML-based and stored in `schema-library/`. They define data models for network infrastructure components. The schema system includes:

- Base schemas (DCIM, IPAM, Location, Organization)
- Extensions (Routing, Security, Compute, etc.)
- Schema visualization and validation

### Key Dependencies

- Streamlit for web UI
- Infrahub SDK for backend operations
- OpenAI/LangChain for AI features
- Poetry for dependency management
- Ruff, MyPy, Pylint for code quality

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Python 3.10-3.12 compatibility required
- Follow existing patterns in `emma/` utilities
- Use type hints where possible
- All code must pass linting checks

### Testing

- Tests use pytest framework
- Test configuration in `pyproject.toml`
- Add tests for new features in appropriate test files

### Schema Development

- Schemas are YAML files in `schema-library/`
- Follow existing schema structure and naming conventions
- Include proper descriptions and examples
- Test schemas with the schema visualizer before committing

### Documentation Guidelines

- All documentation files are in `docs/docs/` and use `.mdx` format
- **ALWAYS run markdownlint before committing documentation changes**: `markdownlint docs/docs/**/*.mdx`
- Use `markdownlint --fix docs/docs/**/*.mdx` to automatically fix formatting issues
- Follow the project's `.markdownlint.yaml` configuration
- Test documentation builds with `cd docs && npm run build` before submitting
- Documentation follows the Diataxis framework (Getting Started, Features, Guides, Reference)

## Prompt for Writing Technical Documentation for Infrahub

This master prompt serves as a comprehensive guide for AI systems tasked with writing technical documentation for Infrahub by OpsMill. The prompt defines the objectives, structure, tone, style, and key considerations necessary to produce clear, useful, and accurate documentation tailored to the needs of Infrahub users.

The documentation structure follows the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/), which organizes documentation into four distinct modes based on their purpose: tutorials (learning-oriented), how-to guides (task-oriented), explanation (understanding-oriented), and reference (information-oriented). This prompt focuses primarily on how-to guides and explanation documentation to ensure content meets users' specific needs effectively.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Role Definition

The assumed role for generating documentation is that of an Expert Technical Writer and MDX Generator.

This role goes beyond traditional writing, it combines:

- Deep understanding of infrahub and its capabilities
- Expertise in network automation and infrastructure management
- Proficiency in writing structured MDX documents
- Awareness of developer ergonomics

### üîç Overview of Infrahub

Infrahub from OpsMill is taking a new approach to Infrastructure Management by providing a new generation of datastore to organize and control all the data that defines how an infrastructure should run. Infrahub offers a central hub to manage the data, templates and playbooks that powers your infrastructure by combining the version control and branch management capabilities similar to Git with the flexible data model and UI of a graph database.

Documentation generated for Infrahub must reflect this novel approach, providing clarity around new concepts and demonstrating how they integrate with familiar patterns from existing tools like Git, infrastructure-as-code, and CI/CD pipelines.

### üéØ Purpose of Documentation

The documentation must:

- Guide users through installing, configuring, and using Infrahub in real-world workflows.
- Explain concepts and system architecture clearly, including new paradigms introduced by Infrahub.
- Support troubleshooting and advanced use cases with actionable, well-organized content.
- Enable adoption by offering approachable examples and hands-on guides that lower the learning curve.

The documentation is both an onboarding and a reference tool, serving developers, DevOps engineers, and platform teams.

### üñãÔ∏è Tone and Style

- Professional but approachable: Avoid jargon unless well defined. Use plain language with technical precision.
- Concise and direct: Prefer short, active sentences. Reduce fluff.
- Informative over promotional: Focus on explaining how and why, not on marketing.
- Consistent and structured: Follow a predictable pattern across sections and documents.

#### For Guides

- Use conditional imperatives: "If you want X, do Y. To achieve W, do Z."
- Focus on practical tasks and problems, not the tools themselves
- Address the user directly using imperative verbs: "Configure...", "Create...", "Deploy..."
- Maintain focus on the specific goal without digressing into explanations
- Use clear titles that state exactly what the guide shows how to accomplish

#### For Topics

- Use a more discursive, reflective tone that invites understanding
- Include context, background, and rationale behind design decisions
- Make connections between concepts and to users' existing knowledge
- Present alternative perspectives and approaches where appropriate
- Use illustrative analogies and examples to deepen understanding

### üìÑ Source and Style References

The project uses the following style configuration:

- [.markdownlint.yaml](.markdownlint.yaml) - Contains Markdown linting rules to ensure consistency in formatting

### üß∞ Terminology and Naming Conventions

- Always define new terms when first used. Use callouts or glossary links if possible.
- Prefer domain-relevant language that reflects the user's perspective (e.g., playbooks, branches, schemas, commits).
- Be consistent: follow naming conventions established by Infrahub's data model and UI.

### üë§ Audience Considerations

- Primary audience: Automation engineers, Software engineers, Network operation teams, infrastructure teams.
- Assumed knowledge: Basic understanding of Git, CI/CD, YAML/JSON, and infrastructure-as-code tools.
- Not assumed: Prior knowledge of Infrahub. All core concepts must be introduced from first principles.

Adjust complexity and terminology accordingly, erring on the side of accessibility.

### ü™µ Document Structure and Patterns Following Diataxis
